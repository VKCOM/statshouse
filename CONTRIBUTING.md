# Contributing to StatsHouse

StatsHouse welcomes your help!

The best way to contribute is to [report issues](https://github.com/VKCOM/statshouse/issues) about
anything that is not working, or about anything that is not working as well as it theoretically could.

Before proposing any significant changes in a pull request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/VKCOM/statshouse/issues)
to discuss the idea, implementation, and how it aligns with StatsHouse vision and plans.
