# Migrate

Migrate to StatsHouse from the popular monitoring tools such as Grafana and Prometheus.

Learn more about the StatsHouse [features](../conceptual%20overview/features.md).

## How to migrate from Grafana

Initially, StatsHouse provided users with the 
[Grafana data source plugin](https://github.com/VKCOM/statshouse/tree/master/grafana-plugin-ui). We discontinued the 
plugin developmentâ€”we put our effort to developing StatsHouse visualizing system.

To help our users migrate, we focus on implementing widgets, thresholds, improved table view, 
support for several metrics on a graph, and more.
