# Use hardware (host) metrics

Popular hardware (host) metrics are displayed in StatsHouse out of the box:
* You can view them as individual metrics: host metric names begin with `host_`.
* You can view them on the _Hardware info_ dashboard:

Find the host metrics implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/VKCOM/statshouse/blob/1c45de2c5ecee27a767a4821ed85315c1a0dff49/internal/format/predefined_hardware.go#L37).

## How to use tags for the hardware (host) metrics

To configure tag values for the host metrics, use the optional `--env-file-path`
parameter when [starting the agent](install.md#agents).

The default file is `/etc/statshouse_env.yml`. You can specify your YAML file as the command line parameter:
```
--env-file-path my_env.yml
```
In this file, specify the values for the standard host metric tags.

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # (hostname: myhost)

[//]: # (env: production)

[//]: # (group: group_name)

[//]: # (dc: data_center_name)

[//]: # (region: spb)

[//]: # (owner: example_team)

[//]: # (```)

For your convenience, define the way the teams in your organization name the tag values.
For example, all the teams should use the `production` value â€” not the `prod`, `Production`, etc.
