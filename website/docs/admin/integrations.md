# Integrate

StatsHouse provides you with interfaces to integrate the "sidecar" systems:

Find the API to extend StatsHouse features with 
* an [access management system](manage-budgets.md#manage-access-for-namespaces) so that you can grant access to viewing or editing options;
* an [authentication](install.md#authentication) mechanism to control the [API/UI component](install.md#apiui) usage;
* a meta-information system to augment your metric data with information about the organizational structure, code
  owners, tagging system, and more;
* an alerting system to configure watchdogs for critical events.
