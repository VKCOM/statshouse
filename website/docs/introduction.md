# What is StatsHouse?

StatsHouse is a monitoring system that is highly available, scalable, and multi-tenant.
It is robust, and one can hardly overload itâ€”due to [aggregation] and [sampling].

It allows your applications to send metric data without limitations, and you can view statistics on a graph in a live 
mode.
