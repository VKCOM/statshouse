# Access a cluster

Before you are able to send and view metric data, make sure you have access to a running StatsHouse cluster.

:::info
We suppose you already have a StatsHouse cluster deployed in your organization, so you only have to get
corresponding internal permissions.

Otherwise, you can [build StatsHouse locally](#build-statshouse-locally).
