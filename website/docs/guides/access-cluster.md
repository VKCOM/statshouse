# Get access to StatsHouse

Before you are able to send and view metric data, make sure you have access to StatsHouse.

We suppose you already have StatsHouse deployed in your organization, so you only have to get
corresponding internal permissions.

Otherwise, [run StatsHouse locally](../quick-start.md#run-statshouse-locally) or 
[deploy your own StatsHouse cluster](../admin/install.md).
