# Create a metric

[Create a metric via the StatsHouse UI](#how-to-create-a-metric-in-the-ui). If you have questions, please [check the 
typical ones](#frequent-questions).

## How to create a metric in the UI

To create a metric, give it a name.

In the StatsHouse UI, go to the main **âš¡** menu in the upper-left corner and select **Create metric**:

<img src={CreateMetric} width="300"/>

Please [avoid creating "one big metric"](send-data.md#can-i-change-or-combine-metric-types) for the whole system. 
Instead, create several metrics, named consistently. For such a group of metrics, related to a particular system (a 
product or a service), use prefixes or other specifications:

<img src={NameMetric} width="600"/>

Please use these characters:
* Latin alphabet
* integers
* underscores

:::note
Do not start metric names with underscores. They are for StatsHouse internal use only.
:::

As soon as your metric has a name, choose the [metric type](edit-metrics.md#metric-type) and start [sending data](send-data.md).

## FAQs about creating metrics

Before you get your first metric in StatsHouse, you may have questions:

#### "Can I skip creating a metric and start sending data to it right away?"

No. _Before_ sending data to a metric, you have to create a metric _manually via the StatsHouse UI_.
Otherwise, you will not be able to see it.

#### "Can I automate creating metrics?"

No. You cannot automate creating metrics: the data you send should be properly formatted. Also, there are limits to
creating metrics related to the StatsHouse mapping mechanism.
See more about [mapping and budgets for creating metrics](../conceptual-overview.md#mapping-and-budgets-for-creating-metrics).

#### "How many metrics can I create?"

In most cases, you should not worry about limits if you create metrics manually via the UI. If you are not sure, see
more about [mapping and budgets for creating metrics](../conceptual-overview.md#mapping-and-budgets-for-creating-metrics).

#### "What if I send too much data? Can I overload StatsHouse or spoil other metrics?"

Most likely, you cannot do anything wrong to StatsHouse or other users with your metrics. It is almost
impossible to overload StatsHouse due to [aggregation](../conceptual-overview.md#aggregation)
and [sampling](../conceptual-overview.md#sampling).
StatsHouse also provides users with [fair resource sharing](../conceptual-overview.md#fair-resource-sharing),
so no metric can steal budget from the other one.

To learn more about mechanisms that make StatsHouse highly available and scalable, and how they may affect the
resulting data, refer to the [conceptual overview](../conceptual-overview.md).
:::

#### "Can I delete a metric?"

No, but you can disable it. See [how to disable or enable a metric](edit-metrics.md#disabling-a-metric).

#### "I want to re-design my metric. Should I refactor it or create a new one?"

If you refactor your existing metric, the data may become confusing or uninformative.
If you create a new metric, please note that you cannot reuse the name of
an existing (even disabled) metric.
