# Create a metric

[Check the typical questions](#frequent-questions) and [create a metric via the StatsHouse UI](#how-to-create-a-metric-in-the-ui).

## Frequent questions

Before you get your first metric in StatsHouse, you may have questions:

> "Can I skip creating a metric and start sending data to it right away?"

No. _Before_ sending data to a metric, you have to create a metric _manually via the StatsHouse UI_.
Otherwise, you will not be able to see it.

> "Can I automate creating metrics?"

No. You cannot automate creating metrics: the data you send should be properly formatted. Also, there are limits to 
creating metrics related to the StatsHouse mapping mechanism. 
See more about [mapping and budgets for creating metrics](../conceptual-overview/draft.md).

> "How many metrics can I create?"
 
In most cases, you should not worry about limits if you create metrics manually via the UI. If you are not sure, see 
more about [mapping and budgets for creating metrics](../conceptual-overview/draft.md).

> "What if I send too much data? Can I overload StatsHouse or spoil other metrics?"

Most likely, you cannot do anything wrong to StatsHouse or other users with your metrics. It is almost 
impossible to overload StatsHouse due to [aggregation] and [sampling]. StatsHouse also provides users with [fair 
resource sharing], so no metric can steal budget from the other one.

To learn more about mechanisms that make StatsHouse highly available and scalable, and how they may affect the 
resulting data, refer to the [conceptual overview].

> "Can I delete a metric?"

No, but you can disable it. See [how to disable or enable a metric](configure-metric.md#disabling-a-metric).

## How to create a metric in the UI

To create a metric, give it a name:

1. In the StatsHouse UI, go to the main **âš¡** menu in the upper-left corner and select **Create metric**:

<img src={CreateMetric} width="300"/>

2. In StatsHouse, there may be more than 10.000 metrics, so naming your metrics properly will help you and other 
users to find the necessary one.
If you have a group of metrics related to a particular product or a service, you can use prefixes or other 
specifications to name them consistently:

<img src={NameMetric} width="600"/>

As soon as your metric has a name, you should understand the [metric type](configure-metric.md#metric-type) and specify it in 
your sending requests. 
Then, you can [configure](configure-metric.md) more parameters for your metric, or start [sending data](send-data.md) 
right away.
