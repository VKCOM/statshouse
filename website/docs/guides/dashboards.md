# Create and view dashboards

A dashboard is a graphical report of data relevant to a particular system (a product or a service):

<img src={Dash} width="900"/>

Check the main StatsHouse menu to [refer to existing dashboards](#refer-to-existing-dashboards),
or [create](#create-a-dashboard) and [edit](#edit-a-dashboard) your ones.

## Refer to existing dashboards

Choose an existing dashboard from a list:

<img src={DashList} width="700"/>

## Create a dashboard

StatsHouse creates a dashboard for a currently viewed metric graph automatically.
To add more graphs on a dashboard, create a new [metric tab](view-graph.md#19--metric-tabs) 
and choose the other necessary metric:

<img src={DashOpen} width="400"/>

## Edit a dashboard

Edit a dashboard to customize its name, description, layout and behavior:

<img src={DashEdit} width="800"/>

Go to _Settings_ to set up a name and description for your dashboard, and enable grouping by tags that are common 
for all the metrics on a dashboard:

<img src={DashGrouping} width="800"/>

In the _Layout_ section, customize the look of the dashboard:

<img src={DashLayout} width="800"/>

## View a dashboard

Use the same [viewing options](view-graph.md) as for the graphs. Reset to a saved state, if necessary:

<img src={DashView} width="800"/>
