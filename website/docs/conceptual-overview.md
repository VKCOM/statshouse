## Sampling

## Fair resource sharing

## Cardinality

## Mapping and budgets for creating metrics

Tag values are often `string` values. StatsHouse maps all of them to `int32` values.
This huge `string`â†”`int32` map is common for all metrics.

## Protocols

Without a client library, you can create a socket, prepare a JSON file, and send your formatted data.
This sounds simple, but only if you have not so much data.

StatsHouse uses [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).
If you send a datagram per event, and there are too many of them,
there is a risk of dropping datagrams, and no one will notice it.

If you do not use the client library, the non-aggregated data will reach StatsHouse
[agent](#agent), and the agent will aggregate them anyway.
